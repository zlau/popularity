The concept is to display information about people, including personal information, such as financial status, political affiliations, religion, etc.  Visitors to the site can then vote on whether they like the personal information about the person, as well as like the person.  People can then be ranked according to how liked they are.  As a statistician, I wanted to be able to analyze data based on how popular the people were (i.e., what is the most popular salary range, etc.).  The site itself is politically incorrect, however the data that could be obtained from such a site has huge implications.
